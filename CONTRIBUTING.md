# How to contribute

Oh hey! Thanks for checking my project out!
I'll be honest, this was meant more as a way for me to track my Blender projects' renders through my Home Assistant server. But I do love improving stuff!
If you have ideas, of course feel free to bring them over. I'll be happy to check them out. ðŸ˜Š

## Submitting changes

Please open [a pull request to this repository](https://github.com/campfred/blender-render-webhooks-addon/pull/new/main) with a clear list of what you've done.
I'd love that if you also include examples of the results from your change so that I understand better the impact of the changes.
If you also give the context for your changes (what prompted to add a feature for example), that would be awesome too!


Thanks!
Camp
