# Render events webhooks for Blender

This script allows to send webhook to servers (like Home Assistant in my use case) for notifying of render events in Blender.

## Supported events

- **Start**
  When a render started.
- **Progress**
- When a render progresses.
- **Complete**
  When a render completed.
- **Cancel**
  When a render is cancelled.
- **Error**
  This one doesn't actually exist in Blender's Python API.
  It's just guessed based on if there's an error message in the render's properties or not upon render cancellation.

## Installation

1. Download script ([`render_webhooks.py`](render_webhooks.py))
2. Open Blender's preferences (`Ctrl` + `,`)
3. Open the Â«Â Add-onsÂ Â» page
4. Click the little down arrow ðŸ”½ at the top right corner and select Â«Â Install from Disk...Â Â»
5. Open the script file ([`render_webhooks.py`](render_webhooks.py))
6. Set your Webhook URL and your paths
   > [!tip] Single webhook operation without paths
   > If you need only a single webhook address without different paths for each event, simply leave the paths empty and set your URL as the Â«Â Webhook URLÂ Â».
   > [!tip] Multiple different webhooks with no commonality between them
   > If you need to call completely different webhook addresses for each event, simply leave the Â«Â Webhook URLÂ Â» empty and put the complete address for each even in their respective paths.

## Data to expect from incoming webhook calls

Webhook calls that will be made by this plugin will contain the following data in the request body.

| Field                           | Value                                                                   | Example              |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `project_name`                  | The project's file name.                                                | `TurntableAnimation` |
| `frame_count`                   | The number of frames to render.                                         | `240`                |
| `progress.percent`              | The percentage completed of the render job.                             | `46`                 |
| `progress.frames.index_first`   | The number of the first frame of the animation to render.               | `0`                  |
| `progress.frames.index_last`    | The number of the last frame of the animation to render.                | `239`                |
| `progress.frames.index_current` | The number of the currently rendering frame of the animation to render. | `111`                |

Here's an example of how it would look on the receiving end.

```json
{
  "project_name": "TurntableAnimation",
  "frame_count": 240, 
  "progress": {
    "percent": 46, // (index_current - index_first) / (index_last - index_first) * 100, rounded
    "frames": {
      "index_first": 0,
      "index_last" : 239,
      "index_current": 111 
    }
}
```
